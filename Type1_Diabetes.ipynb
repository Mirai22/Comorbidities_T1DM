She continued to have\\nnausea/vomiting but was non-bloody bilious vomiting wo coffee\\ngrounds or frank [**Known lastname **]. There was low concern for UGIB - thought\\nto be self resolving [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] vs PUD given Hpylori\\npositive, has been treated in past but unclear if re-infected.\\nShe was started on protonix and octreotide gtt in the ED and was\\ntransitioned to protonix IV bid in the MICU without octreotide\\ngiven clinical stability. She did have grade 1 varix on EGD in\\n[**1-/2132**], though unclear etiology and no hx of prior variceal\\nbleed.  Very low suspicion for variceal bleed given HD\\nstability, HCT stable and cessation of emesis. GI was not\\nconsulted in the ED on presentation and given her clinical\\nstability in the MICU and low suspicion for ongoing GIB, MICU\\nteam did not consult GI as she did not require EGD.  She was\\ntransitioned to PO meds: antiemetics, po dilaudid and\\npantoprazole. She was bolused with NS for dehydration and poor\\npo intake prior to presentation - and tachycardia. Femoral line\\n(placed in the ED) was discontinued prior to transfer to the\\nfloor. Her diet was advanced to clears and then as tolerated.

Continued on home\\ngabapentin.\\n\\n# PTSD\\nPatient has hx of sexual abuse, had psych consult on previous\\nadmission, resulting in setup of outpatient psych eval for day\\nprogram.  She feels these social stressors weigh down her\\nsignificantly, and that the stress may have triggered last DKA\\nepisode.  Citalopram was continued at home dose.
